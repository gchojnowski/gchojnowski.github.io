I provide independent scientific consulting at the interface of **AI-based protein structure prediction** and **integrative structural biology**, supporting academic and biotech projects that require careful model interpretation, method development, or scalable computational workflows.

My work combines experience in experimental structure determination (cryo-EM, macromolecular crystallography, small-angle scattering) with large-scale structure prediction and validation using modern AI-based methods.

## Scope of services

Typical areas of support include:

 - AI-based protein structure and protein–protein complex prediction
 - Validation and interpretation of predicted and experimental structural models
 - Structural analysis to support experimental target selection and prioritisation
 - Large-scale inference campaigns and benchmarking studies
 - Design and deployment of reproducible structure-prediction workflows for HPC and cloud environments
 - Method development in structural bioinformatics and model validation

## Example deliverables

Depending on project scope, deliverables may include:

- Concise technical reports supporting experimental decision-making
- Annotated structural model sets with confidence and validation assessments
- Comparative analyses of alternative structural hypotheses
- Reproducible computational workflows or pipelines
- Feasibility or benchmarking assessments for AI-based modelling approaches
- Accessible protein structure prediction pipelines for HPC and cloud environments, suitable for non-specialist users 

Examples are drawn from recent academic collaborations and early-stage biotech projects.

## Engagement models

Engagements are typically structured as:

- **Short advisory engagements**
  Focused discussions, data or model review, and strategic input

- **Project-based work**
  Defined scope and deliverables, with fixed or capped budgets

- **Retainer arrangements**
  Reserved consulting capacity for ongoing collaboration across project phases

Details are agreed in advance based on scope and computational requirements.

## Practicalities

- Location: Hamburg, Germany (remote work by default)
- Availability: project-based and advisory engagements
- Cloud compute costs are handled separately from consulting fees
